# FimiX8-RE
Research on hacking our Fimi X8 SE

RC and Drone are powered by OpenWRT.

Tools used so far:
* jadx 0.9
* mitmproxy
* binwalk
* Ghidra

Didn't had much time to document everything yet. Look for files named README.md, I write down my notes in those.

## Contribution
Help is desperately needed!
Anyone with skills in Reverse Engineering, OpenWRT, Embedded, MIPS and so on.
ATM I'm trying to unpack the second stage firmware image (jiffs2 overlay).
